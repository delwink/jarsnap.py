jarsnap.py
==========

Make fat jars

jarsnap.py helps you create deployable executable JAR files by combining
libraries and your main program into a single archive.

Usage
-----

Its most basic usage is as follows:

    $ jarsnap -m Main myprog.jar lib1.jar lib2.jar

This creates a runnable JAR from the three JAR inputs with Main as the main
class. There are other options available as well. Use `jarsnap -h` for more
information.

Installation
------------

jarsnap.py can be installed using the Python setuptools module. It must be
installed to automate the installation.

    # python3 setup.py install
